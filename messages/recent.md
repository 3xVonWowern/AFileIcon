# A File Icon 3.0.0

New release!

`A File Icon` has been recently re-named from `zz File Icons`. If you have no 
local changes, you should have no problems. If you do have local changes, just
remove `zz File Icons` folder if it exists and wait until plugin completes its 
work.

`A File Icon` has been rewritten from scratch to fix most critical bugs. I hope
you'll like it ðŸ˜‰

Please see `Preferences â†’ Package Settings â†’ A File Icon â†’ Changelog` for 
more info about the release.

I've put a lot of time and effort into making `A File Icon` awesome. If you love
