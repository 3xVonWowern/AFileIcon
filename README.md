This package adds file specific icons to Sublime Text for improved visual grepping. It's heavily inspired by [Atom File Icons][atom-file-icons].

Its aims are:

* be a `tmPreferences` storage for UI themes those support file icons,
* provide file type icons for themes those don't (fully) support file icons.

If you have some problems, first search for a similar issue, and then report with [new one][new-issue]. Please read the [known issues][known-issues] before reporting a new one.

## Users

<!-- ### Getting Started -->

### Installation

#### Package Control ([coming soon][coming-soon])

The easiest way to install is using [Package Control][downloads], where it's listed as `zz File Icons`.

1. Open `Command Palette` using menu item `Tools â†’ Command Palette...`
2. Choose `Package Control: Install Package`
3. Find `zz File Icons` and hit `Enter`

#### Download

1. [Download the .zip][release]
2. Unzip and rename the folder to `zz File Icons`
3. Copy the folder into `Packages` directory, which you can find using the menu item `Preferences â†’ Browse Packages...`

> **Note:** Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after installing this package. 

### Customization

You can change the color, opacity level and size of the icons by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using:

* menu item `Preferences â†’ Package Settings â†’ File Icons â†’ Settings`,
* choose `File Icons: Settings` in `Command Palette`.

### Troubleshooting

If something going wrong try to:

1. Open `Command Palette` using menu item `Tools â†’ Command Palette...`
2. Choose `File Icons: Clean Up`
3. Restart Sublime Text

#### Wrong Icons

Sublime Text file type icons use syntax scopes. That's why the icons for packages provided by the community require them to be installed.

See the list of [custom packages][packages] those you may need to install to see the right icon.

#### Missing Icons

In some cases you can see that some icons from your current theme are missing. You can:

- Request support of this package from the theme's developer
- Submit a request to add missing icons if the theme already supports it

[More details here â†’][details] 

#### Sublime Linter Setup

This package adds some syntax aliases which Sublime Linter doesn't recognize. Just update your Sublime Linter settings, e.g.:

```js
  "syntax_map": {
    "html (django)": "html",
    "html (rails)": "html",
    "html 5": "html",
    "javascript (babel)": "javascript",
    "javascript (gruntfile)": "javascript",
    "javascript (gulpfile)": "javascript",
    "json (bower)": "json",
    "json (npm)": "json",
    "json (settings)": "json",
    "magicpython": "python",
    "php": "html",
    "python django": "python",
    "pythonimproved": "python"
  },
```

Full list of the syntax aliases can be found [here][aliases].

## Developers

### Bring Support to Your Theme

If you are a theme developer and you want to have support of `zz File Icons`, you should:

* Remove all stuff related to the icon setup: `.tmPreferences`, `.sublime-settings` and `.tmLanguage` files
* Rename all your icons to match [these ones][icons]
* Add `.zz-file-icons` file to the root of your theme (this is how we check if the theme is **supported**)

Also see [MIGRATION.md][migration]. It contains a list of tasks those you have to do to support the next version of the `zz File Icons`.

### How It Works

In simple terms, `zz File Icons` does next steps:

1. Searches all installed and supported themes
2. Checks if themes those don't support it are already patched, if not
3. Patches them
    - Generates `<theme-name>.sublime-theme` files from [template][template]
    - Puts them into `dist/zpatches/` directory
4. For the themes those have support of it, it just provides `.tmPreferences` files by default (user can override icons provided by the theme via `"force_override": true`)
5. After restarting Sublime Text, the patched themes will be enhanced to use the icons provided by `zz File Icons`

It does these steps when:

- you've installed it,
- plugins loaded,
- you've changed its preferences.

The real process is just a little bit more complex to minimize hard drive I/O.

## Resources

### Colors

Colors are from the [Boxy Theme][boxy-theme] icon color palette. They are bright because they should look good with the most themes. However you can change the color and the opacity level of all icons, see [customization][customization].

![Palette][img-palette]

### Icons

This package contains icons provided by:

- [Atom File Icons][atom-file-icons]

- [Devicons][devicons]
- [Font Awesome][font-awesome]
- [Font Mfizz][font-mfizz]
- [Icomoon][icomoon]
- [Octicons][octicons]

Source icons provided in SVG format (currently Sublime Text doesn't support it). We convert them to @1x, @2x and @3x PNG assets before each release via `gulp` task. 

Rasterized icons can be found in `dist/zpatches` folder.
